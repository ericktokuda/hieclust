# 3d visualization of public datasets

Below we can visualize the plot of different data. It can be observed that their visual shape is in accordance with the model proposed in ![Revisitting agglomerative clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07995) of a nucleus, a periphel region and the outliers. The datasets used were ![Abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone), ![Bank marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) and the ![Breast cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) datasets.
