# 3d visualization of public datasets

In ![Revisitting agglomerative clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07995) we argued that real data often follows a structure composed of a nucleus, a peripheral region and the outliers. In the article, several 2d examples were analyzed.

Here we present some 3d visualization of the same datasets used in the paper. In particular, the plots below were obtained using data from the ![Abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone), the ![Bank marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) and the ![Breast cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) datasets.
